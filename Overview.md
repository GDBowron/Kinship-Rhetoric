## Mini-project on Kinship Terms in Patriotic Rhetoric
This project will, at least initially, be primarily a literature review surrounding the use of kinship terms in patriotic political rhetoric. Examples of these terms include fatherland and motherland. I will endeavour to elucidate the nature of current research on the use of these differently gendered terms, synthesise a general thesis, and propose avenues for future research. Ideally, I would also conduct primary research on the geographical and ideological distributions of these terms to further develop a thesis on the political implications of the use of these terms, potentially via textual analysis, however, I need to further develop my methodological skills to do this.
